STDEV: ()
z score: how many standard deviations (omega) an average is from the mean (sample mean / omega (stand dev of population)

standard error (se) = omega/sqrt(n)      (omega is standard dev, n = number of sample)

Confidence Intervals = Always 1.96 standarddev away from mean for 95%
	To calculate =     mean of sample + (or minus) 1.96(standard error)

	
-T Tests:
	2 Tails results are more conservative and we're less likely to reject the not null hypoth
	One T test also called directional test because you pick which way the score is being tested, against which tail
	t = xbar - mu /  (s/sqrt(n))
	s = se/sqrt(n)
	Small sample size (If n<30, then t-test is more suitable )
	Unknown population standard deviation? (Can not we use z-test when population variance is unknown)
	
	
For dealing with differences and t tests:
Xd = X2-X1
SDd = SQRT(sd1^2 + sd2^2)....taking the stdev NORMALLY of the difference seems to be the correct way!
Tcritd = Xd - 0  /  SDd/(sqrt(n))

SUPPORT: http://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/17/topic-library/basic-statistics-and-graphs/hypothesis-tests/basics/null-and-alternative-hypotheses/

SE of difference: SQRT((sd1^2/n1) + (sd2^2/n2))

margin of error: tcrit * SEM 

cohen's d: (xbar - mu) / standdev   = in order to create a standardized mean difference

r2 = t2/(t2 + df)

SEM (standard error of the mean) =  standarddev /  sqrt(n)    =   the standdev of the mean of samples

Pooled Variances
Sp2 = SS1 + SS2 / df1 + df2
SE with pooled var = sqrt(sp2/n1 + sp2/n2)
tstat = XbarDifference / SE of diff

UNDERSTANDING:
-Standard Deviation vs Stardard Error
	It helps to first understand a sampling distribution:  it's the distribution of all possible sample means of the same size.  IE:  from a given population
		you take all possible sample combinations for a fixed sample size and then plot all the averages.
	width of the sampling distribution = refers to the standard error (is also the same as the SD of the sampling distribution, but that's too confusing to say!)
	Therefore the SE refers to the sampling distribtution and the SD refers to the population (or sample) distribution 

-When analyzing samples, use xbar instead of mu for the average!
